    <header><h2>First Struggle</h2></header>
    <p>The first struggle in my journey to coding supremacy, was actually getting all the necessary bits onto my computer. I'm a complete novice to all of this, and I have a short fuse, so any time my computer does something unexpected, incomprehensible screeching ensues. Have you seen the show 'Adeventure Time'? If you're familiar-enough with it to know the character Lemongrab, you've got a good idea of the kind of screeching I'm talking about.</p>

    <p>Possibly the most frustrating part of my [currently low] skill level, is that when something <em>does</em> go wrong, I usually don't know enough about what I did to cause the malfunction in the first place to know how to phrase an effective plea for help. If there's an error message I just paste that into Google. To be honest, that's usually enough. If I learned anything in three years at university, it can be almost completely summed up thus:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>cite your sources</li>
        <li>somebody else has almost definitely already asked that question</li>
      </ul>

    <header><h2>Second Struggle</h2></header>
    <p>My second struggle has been time. I started this knowing full well the demands it would make on my time, and I've used a fair bit trying to figure out where I can get more. See, I work fifty hours a week. That's a big chunk right there, and my commute takes it up to somewhere around sixty hours a week - all dedicated to my job.</p>
    <p>This wouldn't bother me at all if I felt that my time there was being put to good use. All year I've been run off my feet at work, constantly going from one task to the next with barely a minute to catch my breath in between. And now, all of a sudden, it's ground to a halt. The work has suddenly dried up. Every morning, I meet with the Line Producer and the Production Coordinator. They ask me, "What's in your schedule today, Tori?" I look down at that day's blank page in my diary, look back up at them. I can't exactly say, "Well I'd like to get through a few chapters on mindfulness," and there's only so many times one can take inventory of the office stationary.</p>
    <p>Tricky. Very tricky.</p>
